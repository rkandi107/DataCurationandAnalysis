Wikipedia Page Data Analysis

Description

This program is designed to extract and analyze data from Wikipedia pages under the category of "Python (programming language) software". It fetches data using the Wikipedia API, processes the data into a structured format, saves the raw data to a JSON file, analyzes the data, exports it to a CSV file, and generates visualizations to provide insights into the page lengths and update frequencies of these Wikipedia pages.

Dependencies

requests
json
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn (if using seaborn for visualization)
Data Collection

The data collection is performed in two main steps:

Fetching the titles of all pages in the specified category.
Fetching detailed information for each page using the titles obtained from step 1.
The data is fetched from the Wikipedia API using the requests library. The endpoint used is https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php. The params dictionary contains the parameters for the API request.

Data Processing

The data processing involves:

Extracting relevant information from the raw data.
Converting the 'touched' timestamp to a pandas datetime object.
Calculating the number of days since the last update for each page.
Data Analysis

The data analysis focuses on two aspects:

Distribution of page lengths.
Days since the last update for each page.
These aspects are visualized using histograms and bar plots, respectively, generated using the matplotlib library.

Data Export

The program exports the processed data to a CSV file named wiki_page_info.csv for further analysis or reference. It also saves the raw JSON response to a file named raw_data.json.

Data Provenance

The data is sourced directly from Wikipedia via its public API. It is important to note that the data might have certain biases inherent to Wikipedia, such as the potential for more frequently updated or longer pages on more popular or controversial topics.

Data Quirks

The 'touched' timestamp only indicates the last time the page was "touched" in any way, which may not always reflect a substantive content update.
The page length in bytes may not directly correlate to the amount or quality of content on the page, as it also includes markup and metadata.
Visualizations

Distribution of Page Lengths: This histogram provides a visual representation of the distribution of page lengths, helping to identify common page lengths and outliers.
Days Since Last Update for Each Page: This bar plot illustrates the number of days since the last update for each page, which can provide insights into the maintenance and currency of the pages in this category.

Conclusion

This program provides a structured approach to collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from Wikipedia pages on Python software. Through this analysis, users can gain insights into the characteristics and maintenance of these pages.
